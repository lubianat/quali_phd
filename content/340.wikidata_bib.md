## Wikidata Bib and a professional system for biocuration

### Introduction 

* Accountants have Double-entry bookkeeping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping), software developers have Test-driven development (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).

* Develop a professional way for coverage of large-scale revisions, inspired by Umberto Eco's How to Write a Thesis [@wikidata:Q3684178] adapted to the digital environment, using version-control and semantic links. 

* Connect the reading framework with a Biocuration strategy to feed knowledge to Wikidata
