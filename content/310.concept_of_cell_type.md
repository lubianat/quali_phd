## Concept of cell types  {.page_break_before}


### General work on the concept of cell type
As an initial step of this PhD project, we decided to investigate the definition of "cell type" and how to shape a definition for knowledge management on Wikidata. 
The definition of the concept of "cell type" is currently a topic of debate by the biomedical community.[@wikidata:Q87649649; @doi:10.1242/dev.169854; @doi:10.1242/dev.178996; @wikidata:Q47565008; @wikidata:Q99418657; @wikidata:Q98665291; @wikidata:Q93086971; @wikidata:Q26770736; @wikidata:Q35688096; @wikidata:Q98633613; @wikidata:Q99418649; @wikidata:Q40436539].
Before we proceeded with the knowledge-graph formalizations via Wikidata, we dedicated time for a theoretical research on the concept of "cell type" in the context of knowledge representation. 
This line of research aligns itself with the groundwork of the Cell Ontology [@wikidata:Q21184168; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-6; @doi:10.1186/s13326-016-0088-7] and CELDA [@wikidata:Q21284308]  and the contributions of the International Workshop on Cells in Experimental Life Sciences series [@doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1976-2; @doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2721-9].

In this period, we targeted the question: which cell type definition allows crafting coherent biological statements? 
The goal was to not say what cell types _are_, but what they can be for a consistent representation on an ontology or a knowledge graph, like Wikidata.
We avoided the dissection of the differences between persistent classes of cells (often called "cell types") or the transient, fugacious classes of cells (often called "cell states") (see "Definition of cell identity" section in [@wikidata:Q48563763] for an example).
Even though such a distinction is an essential topic for theoretical research, it is not required to represent formally biomedical experiments.

To facilitate communication among life scientists, in a preprint derived from this PHD project[@doi:10.22541/au.160979530.02627436/v1], we proposed, among other theoretical novelties, naming conventions for different cell types classes. 
Much of the literature mixes cell types in one species (e.g., when dealing with a cell type as an evolutionary unit) or multiple species (e.g., in the Cell Ontology). 
It is useful to distill these different concepts into names. Given the importance of the species' concept in biological classification [@wikidata:Q1189395], we derive a species-centric view on the naming of classes of cell types. 
The four classes (Figure @fig:classes) we propose are as follows:

- archetypes, for when the taxonomic scope of the type is beyond the level of species; for example, "mammal neutrophils."
- _sensu stricto_ cell types, for when the taxonomic scope of the type corresponds to a single species; for example, _Mus musculus_ neutrophils."
- infratypes, for when the taxonomic scope is below the level of species; for example, considering the mouse strain "C57BL/6J", "neutrophils from C57BL/6J mice". 
- technotypes, for specific, experimentally defined cell types that harbor in their definition the precise conditions of the cells sampled; “2-month-old male C57BL/6J, Ly-6G<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup>  M-CSF R<sup>-</sup>  CD244<sup>-</sup> neutrophils”.

The 4 different categories of cell types help us to better organize the knowledge about cell types. 
Even though individual articles and databases often have species-neutral names, the information often comes from experiments with a single strain of a single species.
Two articles might call by the same name cells that come from different animals, or were selected by different protocols. 
Large scale knowledge management requires an organized way of representing those details.

The division between archetypes and _sensu stricto_ cell types is of special importance in the context of biocuration and annotation of data. 
Associations like the  HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee and UniProt organize names and identifiers for genes and proteins in single species. 
Thus, if we want to annotate marker genes, for example, we need to associate them to a species-specific cell type (a _sensu stricto_ cell type) instead of the more vague association to a species-neutral type. 
That might seem obvious, but current standards still use identifiers that are species-neutral (e.g. in the reference HuBMAP app; <https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/references/>)

The ontological discussion on the classes of cell types, thus, extends the current state-of-the-art and introduce new ways to organize our knowledge about cells. 
Notably, the technotype and the infratype are, currently, mostly theoretical constructs and almost no resources deal with cell types at the level of strains or below. 
The division of archetypes and _sensu stricto_ cell types, on the other hand, was already instrumental for the integration of the Panglao database of cell markers to Wikidata, described in a future session.

### A simplified definition

 Refining the different concepts around the notion of "cell type" is important, but will require decades before a reasonable consensus. 
Here we adopt a liberal view of cell type, defining, for our purposes, a cell type as "any class of cells described by a domain expert".
By "class" we mean an abstract entity in the sense intended by the multilevel theory of conceptual modelling (referred as "_types_" by Carvalho et al. ) [@wikidata:Q108926456]

Figure @fig:multilevel represents the adaptation of Multi Level Theory that is assumed for the modelling done throughout this work. 
The notion is time-agnostic (i.e. it is not concerned if their objects _exist now_ or just _existed in the past_) and organizes the theoretical world into 3 kingdoms: _individuals_, _classes_ and _metaclasses_.

Figure @fig:multilevel A multilevel theory (MLT) can divide the theoretical realm into different kingdoms. A) A representation of people in the MLT framework adopted in this work. The theoretical-realm entity "Mahatma Gandhi" is materialized by the material-realm Mahatma Gandhi. The theoretical _individual_ is considered an instance of  multiple _classes_ such as "Indian lawyer" and "_Homo sapiens_", which are related to each other via subclass relations. The classes themselves are instances of _metaclasses_, like "taxon", a first order metaclass. B) An analogous representation of the MLT framework, but applied to cells and cell types.
