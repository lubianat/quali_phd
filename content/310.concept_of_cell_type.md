## Concept of cell types  {.page_break_before}

### General work on the concept of cell type
As an initial step of this PhD project, we decided to investigate the definition of "cell type" and how to shape a definition for knowledge management on Wikidata. 
The definition of the concept of "cell type" is currently a topic of debate by the biomedical community.[@wikidata:Q87649649; @doi:10.1242/dev.169854; @doi:10.1242/dev.178996; @wikidata:Q47565008; @wikidata:Q99418657; @wikidata:Q98665291; @wikidata:Q93086971; @wikidata:Q26770736; @wikidata:Q35688096; @wikidata:Q98633613; @wikidata:Q99418649; @wikidata:Q40436539].
Before we proceeded with the knowledge-graph formalizations via Wikidata, we dedicated time for a theoretical research on the concept of "cell type" in the context of knowledge representation. 
This line of research aligns itself with the groundwork of the Cell Ontology [@wikidata:Q21184168; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-6; @doi:10.1186/s13326-016-0088-7] and CELDA [@wikidata:Q21284308]  and the contributions of the International Workshop on Cells in Experimental Life Sciences series [@doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1976-2; @doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2721-9].

In this period, we targeted the question: which cell type definition allows crafting coherent biological statements? 
The goal was to not say what cell types _are_, but what they can be for a consistent representation on an ontology or a knowledge graph, like Wikidata.
We avoided the dissection of the differences between persistent classes of cells (often called "cell types") or the transient, fugacious classes of cells (often called "cell states") (see "Definition of cell identity" section in [@wikidata:Q48563763] for an example).
Even though such a distinction is an essential topic for theoretical research, it is not required to represent formally biomedical experiments.

To facilitate communication among life scientists, in a preprint derived from this PHD project[@doi:10.22541/au.160979530.02627436/v1], we proposed, among other theoretical novelties, naming conventions for different cell types classes. 
Much of the literature mixes cell types in one species (e.g., when dealing with a cell type as an evolutionary unit) or multiple species (e.g., in the Cell Ontology). 
It is useful to distill these different concepts into names. Given the importance of the species' concept in biological classification [@wikidata:Q1189395], we derive a species-centric view on the naming of classes of cell types. 
The four classes (Figure @fig:classes) we propose are as follows:

- archetypes, for when the taxonomic scope of the type is beyond the level of species; for example, "mammal neutrophils."
- _sensu stricto_ cell types, for when the taxonomic scope of the type corresponds to a single species; for example, _Mus musculus_ neutrophils."
- infratypes, for when the taxonomic scope is below the level of species; for example, considering the mouse strain "C57BL/6J", "neutrophils from C57BL/6J mice". 
- technotypes, for specific, experimentally defined cell types that harbor in their definition the precise conditions of the cells sampled; “2-month-old male C57BL/6J, Ly-6G<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup>  M-CSF R<sup>-</sup>  CD244<sup>-</sup> neutrophils”.

![ Names for classes of cell types.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lubianat/fapesp_report_1/main/content/images/archetypes_hn.jpg){#fig:classes}

The 4 different categories of cell types help us to better organize the knowledge about cell types. 
Even though individual articles and databases often have species-neutral names, the information often comes from experiments with a single strain of a single species.
Two articles might call by the same name cells that come from different animals, or were selected by different protocols. 
Large scale knowledge management requires an organized way of representing those details.

The division between archetypes and _sensu stricto_ cell types is of special importance in the context of biocuration and annotation of data. 
Associations like the  HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee and UniProt organize names and identifiers for genes and proteins in single species. 
Thus, if we want to annotate marker genes, for example, we need to associate them to a species-specific cell type (a _sensu stricto_ cell type) instead of the more vague association to a species-neutral type. 
That might seem obvious, but current standards still use identifiers that are species-neutral (e.g. in the reference HuBMAP app; <https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/references/>)

The ontological discussion on the classes of cell types, thus, extends the current state-of-the-art and introduce new ways to organize our knowledge about cells. 
Notably, the technotype and the infratype are, currently, mostly theoretical constructs and almost no resources deal with cell types at the level of strains or below. 
The division of archetypes and _sensu stricto_ cell types, on the other hand, was already instrumental for the integration of the Panglao database of cell markers to Wikidata, described in a future session.

### A simplified definition

 Refining the different concepts around the notion of "cell type" is important, but will require decades before a reasonable consensus. Here we adopt a liberal view of cell type, defining, for our purposes, a cell type as any class of cells described by a domain expert with evidence of reality of its instances.
The requirement of evidence of existence in reality is based on the Principle of instantiation of ontological realism [@wikidata:Q28239464]. Barry Smith and Werner Ceuster states that "A term should be included in a reference ontology only if there is experimental evidence that instances to which that term refers exist in reality.(‘Exists’ here should be understood in a tenseless sense in order to accommodate, for example, universals pertaining to extinct species as well as universals such as swarm or hurricane which are instantiated only intermittently.)"
Thus, in this work one minimum requirement for a cell type to be catalogued is a public description by a researcher of the class, with evidence for existence of instances of the class in reality. 


By "class" we mean an abstract entity in the sense intended by the multilevel theory (MLT) of conceptual modelling (referred as "_types_" by Carvalho et al. ) [@wikidata:Q108926456]
Figure @fig:multilevel displays a simplified version of MLT adopted throughout this project.
In this framework, real-world entities are materializations of _individuals_. 
_Individuals_ are theoretical constructs which are (1) thought to exist or have existed, as per the principle of instantiation, and (2) refer to only one (01) material entity at any point in time. 
For example, Wikidata has entries for people, e.g. "Helder Nakaya ([Q42614737](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42614737))" and "Charles Darwin ([Q1035](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42614737))" which are considered _individuals_ by Multi Level Theory.
Other examples of _individuals_ include "Albert Einstein's brain ([Q2464312](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2464312))" and the "Christ the Redeemer statue ([Q79961](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79961))".

Figure @fig:multilevel A multilevel theory (MLT) can divide the theoretical realm into different kingdoms. A) A representation of people in the MLT framework adopted in this work. The theoretical-realm entity "Mahatma Gandhi" is materialized by the material-realm Mahatma Gandhi. The theoretical _individual_ is considered an instance of  multiple _classes_ such as "Indian lawyer" and "_Homo sapiens_", which are related to each other via subclass relations. The classes themselves are instances of _metaclasses_, like "taxon", a first order metaclass. B) An analogous representation of the MLT framework, but applied to cells and cell types. 

In MLT, _individuals_ are instances of some _classes_.
For example, both "Helder Nakaya ([Q42614737](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42614737))" and "Charles Darwin ([Q1035](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42614737))" could be represented as instances of the class "_Homo sapiens_  ([Q15978631](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15978631))" on Wikidata. 
"_Homo sapiens_ (Q15978631)" is only one of the classes that those individuals belong to.
Another one is "animal ([Q729](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q729))". 
As all instances of "_Homo sapiens_ (Q15978631)" are also instances of "animal (Q729)", "_Homo sapiens_ (Q15978631)" is a subclass of "animal (Q729)".
It is possible to continue the hierarchy of subclasses, as "animal (Q729)" is a subclass of "organism (Q7239)", until the root case, which in the case of wikidata is the class "entity ([Q35120](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q35120))" 


Classes, however, can themselves behave as individuals. 
For example, both "_Homo sapiens_ (Q15978631)" and "animal (Q729)" are instances of "taxon ([Q16521](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16521))".
"Taxon (Q16521)", thus, is a _metaclass_, or, more precisely, a _1st-order metaclass_. 
Other examples of metaclasses are "_species_ ([Q7432](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7432))" and "phylum ([Q38348](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q38348))". 
These, in turn, are instances of "taxonomic rank ([Q427626](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q427626))", a _2nd-order metaclass_. 


In the Figure @fig:multilevel B there is a proposal of this version of MLT for cell types. 
As individual cells are rarely named, for the sake of example, we can consider the "zygote of Mahatman Gandhi" as an _individual_ in the theoretical system, an instance of the class "zygote ([Q170145](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170145))", which is itself an instance of the metaclass "cell type ([Q189118](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q189118))" 
A more concrete example stems from RNA-sequencing datasets with barcodes for each single cell in a particular sample.
Each barcode can be thought as an identifier for an _individual_. 
Thus, labeling single-cells is a process of identification, where each _individual_ is connected to a _class_ of interest.

For the practical purpose adopted here, we avoid the dissection of the differences between persistent classes of cells (often called "cell types") or the transient, fugacious classes of cells (often called "cell states") (see "Definition of cell identity" section in [@wikidata:Q48563763] for an example). We also consider only the cell as it was observed in an experiment, not necessarily the future conditions of any cell (i.e., the "cell fate"). [@wikidata:Q91908361]  
Even though such a distinction is an important topic for theoretical research, it is outside the initial scope of this work. 

Another logical consequence of the definition is that the concept of subtype becomes redundant with the concept of cell type.
The notion of subtype, then, only makes sense when discussing classes with different degrees of universality.
Thus, claims to discover new cell "subtypes" or "types" differ only stylistically and can be considered indistinguishable from the perspective of research synthesis.

We also note that we made a judgment call to use the term "cell type" to emphasize the focus on types as classes (or "kinds") in contrast to real-world objects.
The term "cell class" is also used in the literature and is a suitable synonym for our notion of cell type.
We opted to frame our work around the term "cell type" due to its historical usage and familiarity for the life sciences community.
Other related thems a "cell set," "cell population," and "cell cluster," can also reminisce of a specific, countable group of cells, frequently from the same experiment. 
The term "cell identity" has also been suggested for avoiding the cell type/cell state dilemma [@wikidata:Q64974172], but we avoid it to emphasize a nominalistic perspective (in the Popperian sense[@wikidata:Q108925548]).
In doing so, we reinforce the intent on represent on what cell types are _reported to exist_, instead of trying to state bluntly which cell types _exist_ or are _essential_ of human beings. 

The employment of MLT as described before, and the notion of species-specific cell types are fundamental for the next chapters of this work. 
In the chapter about the PanglaoDB integration, we describe how we used the notion of species-specific types to add marker information to Wikidata, and how we cleaned up conceptual disarrays that broke MLT for cell types.
Later, on the chapter about Wikidata Bib, we describe how we performed a large-scale curation of the biomedical literature for new cell types, using as starting principle the theories discussed here.
