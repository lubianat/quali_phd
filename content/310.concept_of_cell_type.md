## Concept of cell types  {.page_break_before}

### General work on the concept of cell type

As an initial step of this PhD project, we investigatet the definition of "cell type" for knowledge management on Wikidata. 
The definition of "cell type" is a topic of avid debate. [@wikidata:Q87649649; @doi:10.1242/dev.169854; @doi:10.1242/dev.178996; @wikidata:Q47565008; @wikidata:Q99418657; @wikidata:Q98665291; @wikidata:Q93086971; @wikidata:Q26770736; @wikidata:Q35688096; @wikidata:Q98633613; @wikidata:Q99418649; @wikidata:Q40436539].
Before we handled data in a large scale, we dedicated time for solidifying our theoretical basis of "cell type". 

In a preprint derived from this PhD project [@doi:10.22541/au.160979530.02627436/v1], we proposed naming conventions for different cell types classes. 
Much of the literature uses the same names for single species (e.g., when dealing with a cell type as an evolutionary unit) or multiple species (e.g., in the Cell Ontology).
Fe find it helpful to distil these different cases into different categories.
Given the importance of the species' concept in biological classification [@wikidata:Q1189395], we derive a species-centric view on naming classes of cell types. 
Using the notion of "taxonomic scope" as the taxonomic range in which instances of the class are expected to materialize, we propose 4 classes (Figure @fig:classes):

- archetypes, for when the taxonomic scope of the type is beyond the level of species; for example, "mammal neutrophils." Note that this also includes species-neutral cell types, which are assumed to display instances in multiple species. 
- _sensu stricto_ cell types, for when the taxonomic scope of the type corresponds to a single species; for example, _Mus musculus_ neutrophils."
- infratypes, for when the taxonomic scope is below the species level; for example, considering the mouse strain "C57BL/6J", "neutrophils from C57BL/6J mice". 
- technotypes, for specific, experimentally defined cell types that harbor in their definition the precise conditions of the cells sampled; “2-month-old male C57BL/6J, Ly-6G<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup>  M-CSF R<sup>-</sup>  CD244<sup>-</sup> neutrophils”.

By specifying 4 different categories of cell types, we can hone in our organization. 
While resources often do not make the taxonomic scope explicit, it might be inferred. 
For example, the vast majority of biomedical articles present experiments with a single strain or a single species.
While two articles using different species might call some cells by the same name, they have important intrinsic differences. 
Even if functionally equivalent, a mouse fibroblast can never become a human fibroblast, no matter the protocol.  
While implicitly obvious, for computer-based, large scale knowledge management, it becomes necessary to state the obvious.

The division between archetypes and _sensu stricto_ cell types is of particular importance for biocuration and data annotation. 
Usually, names and identifiers for genes and proteins are standardized for single species.[@wikidata:Q42790699] 
Thus, if we want to annotate marker genes, we would do better associating them to a species-specific cell type (a _sensu stricto_ cell type) instead of the more vague association to a species-neutral type. 
Of note, current scRNAseq reference datasets and databases still use species-neutral cell type IDs(e.g. in the reference HuBMAP app; <https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/references/>). 

Our theoretical discussion on the notion of "cell type" extends the current state-of-the-art and introduces new ways to organize our knowledge about cells. 
The technotype and the infratype are currently pure theoretical constructs, and almost no resources deal with cell types at the level of strains or below. 
While we reason that this level of granularity would provide a more precise description of research projects, they are still far from being applicable in the present, and are present as tools for the future. 
The division of archetypes and _sensu stricto_ cell types, on the other hand, was immediate value. 
As an example, it was instrumental for the integration of the Panglao database of cell markers to Wikidata, described in the following session of the results.

### A simplified definition

While theoretical discussion on the notion of "cell type" are important, a reasonable consensus is likely to take longer than the duration of this PhD project.
Here we adopt a liberal view of cell type, defining, for our purposes, a cell type as any class of cells described by a domain expert with evidence of the reality of its instances.
The requirement of evidence of existence in the material world is based on the principle of instantiation of ontological realism [@wikidata:Q28239464]. Barry Smith and Werner Ceuster state  "A term should be included in a reference ontology only if there is experimental evidence that instances to which that term refers exist in reality. ('Exists' here should be understood in a tenseless sense in order to accommodate, for example, universals pertaining to extinct species as well as universals such as swarm or hurricane which are instantiated only intermittently.)"
Following their advice, our minimum requirement for a cell type is public evidence for materializations of its instances. 


By "type", or "class", we mean an abstract entity in a sense intended by the multilevel theory (MLT) of conceptual modelling [@wikidata:Q108926456]
Figure @fig:multilevel displays a simplified version of MLT adopted throughout this project.
In this framework, real-world entities are materializations of _individuals_. 
_Individuals_ are theoretical constructs that are (1) thought to exist or have existed, as per the principle of instantiation, and (2) refer to only one material entity at any point in time. 
For example, Wikidata's entries for "Helder Nakaya ([Q42614737](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42614737))" and "Charles Darwin ([Q1035](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42614737))"  are considered _individuals_ by Multi-Level Theory.
Other examples of _individuals_ include "Albert Einstein's brain ([Q2464312](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2464312))" and the "Christ the Redeemer statue ([Q79961](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79961))".

![A multilevel theory (MLT) can divide the theoretical realm into different kingdoms. A) A representation of people in the MLT framework as adopted in this work. The theoretical-realm entity "Mahatma Gandhi" is materialized by the material-realm Mahatma Gandhi. The theoretical _individual_ is considered an instance of multiple _classes_ such as "Indian lawyer" and "_Homo sapiens_", which are related to each other via subclass relations. The classes themselves are instances of _metaclasses_, like "taxon", a first-order metaclass. B) An analogous representation of the MLT framework, but applied to cells and cell types.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lubianat/multilevel_ontology_drawings/master/combination_human_cell.png){#fig:multilevel width="85%"}


In MLT, _individuals_ are instances of some _classes_.
For example, both "Helder Nakaya ([Q42614737](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42614737))" and "Charles Darwin ([Q1035](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42614737))" could be represented as instances of the class "_Homo sapiens_  ([Q15978631](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15978631))". 
"_Homo sapiens_ (Q15978631)" is only one of the classes that those individuals belong to.
Another one is "animal ([Q729](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q729))". 
As all instances of "_Homo sapiens_ (Q15978631)" are also instances of "animal (Q729)", "_Homo sapiens_ (Q15978631)" is a subclass of "animal (Q729)".
It is possible to continue the hierarchy of subclasses: "animal (Q729)" is a subclass of "organism (Q7239)", and so on until the root case "entity ([Q35120](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q35120))" 


Classes can also behave as individuals in some aspects. 
For example, both "_Homo sapiens_ (Q15978631)" and "animal (Q729)" are instances of "taxon ([Q16521](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16521))".
"Taxon (Q16521)", thus, is a _metaclass_, or, more precisely, a _1st-order metaclass_. 
Other examples of metaclasses are "_species_ ([Q7432](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7432))" and "phylum ([Q38348](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q38348))". 
These, in turn, are instances of "taxonomic rank ([Q427626](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q427626))", a _2nd-order metaclass_. 


In the Figure @fig:multilevel B there is a proposal of this version of MLT for cell types. 
As individual cells are rarely named, for the sake of example, we can consider the "zygote of Mahatman Gandhi" as an _individual_ in the theoretical system, an instance of the _class_ "zygote ([Q170145](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170145))". 
"Zygote(Q170145)" is an instance of the _metaclass_ "cell type ([Q189118](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q189118))" 
A more concrete example of from RNA-sequencing datasets, where there are barcodes for each cell in a particular sample.
Each barcode labels an _individual_. 
Thus, labelling single-cells is a process of identification, where each _individual_ is connected to a _class_ of interest.

We avoid the dissection of the differences between persistent classes of cells (often called "cell types") or the transient, fugacious classes of cells (often called "cell states") (see "Definition of cell identity" section in [@wikidata:Q48563763] for an example). We also consider only the cell as it was observed in an experiment, not necessarily the future conditions of any cell (i.e., the "cell fate"). [@wikidata:Q91908361]  
Even though such a distinction is an important topic for theoretical research, it is outside the initial scope of this work. 

Another  consequence of is that "subtype" becomes redundant with the idea of cell type and differ only stylistically. 
The notion of subtype, only will make sense in context of superclasses, but all in the same kingdom (i.e. the kingdom of classes).

We opted to frame our work around the term "cell type" due to its historical usage and familiarity for the life sciences community.
The term "cell class" is also used in the literature and is a suitable synonym for our notion of cell type.
Other related terms present semantic ambiguities, and were avoided whenever possible. 
For example, terms as "cell set," "cell population," and "cell cluster," can reminisce of a specific, countable group of cells, frequently from the same experiment. 
The term "cell identity" has also been suggested for avoiding the cell type/cell state dilemma [@wikidata:Q64974172], but we avoid it to emphasize a nominalistic perspective (in the Popperian sense[@wikidata:Q108925548]).
In doing so, we reinforce the intent to represent the cell types  _reported to exist_ instead of stating bluntly which cell types _exist_ or are _essential_ for human beings. 

The employment of MLT and species-specific cell type are instrumental for the next chapters of this work. 
In the chapter about the PanglaoDB integration, we describe how we applied the theory to add marker information to Wikidata and cleaned up conceptual disarrays throughout the platform. 
Later, on the chapter about Wikidata Bib, we describe how we performed a large-scale curation of the biomedical literature for new cell types, using the theories discussed here as a starting principle.
