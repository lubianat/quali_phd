## Preface {.page_break_before}

In this preface we present an overview of the chapters in this document.  

The introduction contains an overview of the Human Cell Atlas project and the current state of classifying cells into types. 
Then, it introduces ontologies and knowledge graphs as tools for connecting what we know about cells. 

The methodology section is an overview of the core methods used throughout the work. 
Of note, some chapters in the results section also display methods when they are intimately linked with the results. 

It is worth noticing that the different results shown were not developed chronologically in the order shown. 
The different branches were developed in parallel, with overlapping periods of activity. 
They are organized into separate chapters and part of different publications. 

The discussion on the concept of cell type is presented first, as it is instrumental for the later steps. 
It is followed by an account of how PanglaoDB, a database of cell markers, was integrated into Wikidata.
Then, we present Wikidata Bib, a framework for an organized reading and curation of cell types. 
The framework, although used as a method throughout the PhD project, is also an intelectual product, thus presented in the results session.
To end the results, we discuss how the work integrates with the Cell Ontology, the leading system for organizing cell types. 

After the results, an account of other academic aspects of the project is presented as part of the qualification requirements. 
They present an overview of collaborations, participation in events and academic courses taken during the first part of the PhD project.
