## Preface {.page_break_before}

Here we present an overview of the different chapters that compose this document, presented as the text for a qualifying exam.  
This work is concerned with the conceptual modelling of knowledge about cell types. 
The introduction contains an overview of the Human Cell Atlas project and the current state of classifying cells into types. 
Then, it proceeds to introduce ontologies and knowledge graphs as tools for connecting what we know about cells. 

The methodology section is an overview of the core methods used throughout the work. 
However, as the project contains elements from different scientific traditions, the results chapters might also display particular methods used in the specific branch of the project. 

It is worth noticing that the different results shown were not developed chronologically in the order shown. 
They were actually developed in parallel, with overlapping periods of activity. 
They have been organized into separate chapters, however, as they tackle different perspectives of the subject matter and are part of different publications. 

The discussion on the concept of cell type is presented first, as it is instrumental for the later steps. 
It is followed by an account of how PanglaoDB, a database of cell markers, was integrated into Wikidata, based on a notion of species-specific cell type clarified in the preceding chapter. 

Then, we present Wikidata Bib, a framework for an organized reading of the literature. 
The framework, although used as a method throughout the PhD project, is presented in the results session.
We emphasize the technical and theoretical details of the system are part of the intellectual work put into the project. 
The system evolved into a biocuration platform for the collection of cell types from the literature to Wikidata. 
To end the results, we discuss how our efforts integrate with the Cell Ontology, the currently leading system for organizing cell types. 

Finally, an account of other academic aspects of the project is presented as part of the qualification requirements. 
They present an overview of collaborations, participation in events and academic courses taken during the first part of the PhD project.
