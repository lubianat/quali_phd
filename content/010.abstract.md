# Abstract
The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) is an international effort to characterize every cell type of the human body. 
HCA members are producing cell-level data from virtually all human tissue using techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing, mass cytometry, and multiplexed in situ hybridizations. 
The wealth knowledge stemming from the wealth of data needs management to maximize the societal benefit of HCA.
While semantic technologies have emerged as key players in the data interoperability ecosystem, there are still gaps to bridge. 
Wikidata, a sister project of Wikipedia for structured data, is surfacing as a hub in the semantic web for multiple types of information and bridging experts and the people. 
The connection of the Human Cell Atlas to Wikidata can quickly insert its products into the larger knowledge ecosystem, extending HCA's reach. 
This PhD project aims at studying Wikidata as a platform for representing cell types.  
We review the literature on cell types, refining and formalizing concepts for cell type delimitation.
At the same time, integrate biomedical databases (e.g. PanglaoDB) into the Wikidata infrastructure and we enrich Wikidata with  manually curated cell types.
To optimize the curation, we develop Wikidata Bib, a framework for literature management and organized note-taking system for dealing with the academic literature. 
Finally, we are improving the interplay of Wikidata, the Cell Ontology and software used for single-cell RNA-seq data, inserting Wikidata _de facto_ as a tool for the Human Cell Atlas community.
