## Wikidata and the Cell Ontology interplay

The contributions to cell types on Wikidata will be of most value if they are integrated to the current state-of-art of knowledge representation. 
Arguably, the Cell Ontology is the main source of cell type identifiers in the context of the Human Cell Atlas project.[@wikidata:Q109755180]
Thus, data about cell types on Wikidata must be connected to the Cell Ontology. 

To start the improvement in the interplay of both databases, we proposed and got the approval of a specific Wikidata identifier for the Cell Ontology, the "Cell Ontology ID" (<https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P7963>).
IDs can be added to Wikidata entities and connected them to external databases enabling integrative SPARQL queries. 
Besides using the common Wikidata interface, one can crowd-curate identifiers via a 3rd-party service, Mix'N'Match, which provides a user-friendly framework for connecting identifier catalogues to Wikidata. [@url:http://magnusmanske.de/wordpress/?p=114], as seen in Figure @fig:mixn_match_cl. 
Logically, we created a Mix'N'Match catalogue for harmonizing Cell Ontology IDs to Wikidata (<https://mix-n-match.toolforge.org/#/catalog/4719>), harnessing the community support for the task.

As of early December 2021, more than 700 Cell Ontology IDs have been manually matched to Wikidata. 
The integration already enables queries that harness the previously existing information on Wikidata for Cell Ontology-based applications. 
For example, one can query Wikidata items that have (1) a crossref to a CL ID (2) a picture in Wikimedia Commons (<https://w.wiki/4F6e>, Figure @fig:cl_images). 
The different possibilities of mutual benefit between the Cell Ontology and Wikidata will continue to be explored in the following years of this PhD project.
