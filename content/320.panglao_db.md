## PanglaoDB integration to Wikidata  {.page_break_before}

### Introduction

Making the Human Cell Atlas more useful via Wikidata also includes the connection of related databases. 
PanglaoDB [@https://panglaodb.se/index.html] [@doi:10.1093/database/baz046] is a publically-available database that contains data and metadata on hundreds of single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. 
It provides extensive information on cell types, genes, tissues, and cell type markers, obtained via automatic and manual methods.
It also displays a rich web user interface for easy data acquisition, including database dumps for bulk downloads.


As of 8 December June 2021, the article describing PanglaoDB had been cited 230 times. 
Despite its use by the community, the database is on a 3-star category for Linked Open Data [@url:https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html] as it does not use the open semantic standards from W3C (RDF and SPARQL) needed for a 4-star rank, neither the links to external data via standard identifiers that make datasets 5-star. 
Improving the data format toward W3C's gold standards is a valuable step in making biological knowledge FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). 
Thus, we aimed to provide a case study of making the core information of PandlaoDB available in a 5-star Linked Open Data Format while improving the modelling of the necessary concepts on Wikidata.

As of August 2020, Wikidata had 264 items categorized as a "cell type", considerably less than in specialized cell catalogues, which count over two thousand cell types [@wikidata:Q28660708; @wikidata:Q36067763].
Strikingly, there were also 23 items categorized as instances of "cell (Q7868)". 
This classification is imprecise, as an instance of cell would be an individual named cell from a single named individual, an example of conceptual disarray that often occurs on Wikidata. [@wikidata:Q109990743]

Wikidata editors often mix 1st-order classes such as "cells" and "organs" with metaclasses like "cell types" and "organ types".
As mentioned in the chapter on the concept of cell type, individuals, like the "Dolly sheep zygote" (a real-world "cell") and the "brain of Albert Einstein" (a real-world "organ") are instances of classes.
Classes, like "zygote" (a conceptual "cell type") and "brain" (a conceptual "organ type") are instances of _metaclasses_. 

We diligently fixed and improved the conceptual consistency of cell type entries on Wikidata. 
As of 8 December 2021, the Wikidata database contains 2834 instances of "cell type" (see current status at <https://w.wiki/b2t>) and 0 instances of "cell" (<https://w.wiki/4XAg>) highlighting the improvements in both quantity and quality. 
This increase stems from the PanglaoDB integration (around 430 new types) and the Wikidata Bib curation described later. 


### Methodology for PanglaoDB integration

After obtaining approval from the database owners, we matched genes and cell types to Wikidata and performed Wikidata queries to demonstrate the value of the approach. 
An overview of the process is shown in @fig:iscb_intro.

### Class creation on Wikidata

Classes corresponding to species-neutral classes were retrieved from Wikidata manually using Wikidata's Graphic User Interface. 
A manually-curated dictionary matching terms in PanglaoDB to Wikidata identifiers was assembled and used for integration. 
Cell types that were not represented on Wikidata were added to the database via the graphical user interface (<https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:NewItem>) and logged in the reference table.

Species-specific cell types for human and mouse cell types were created for every entry in the reference table and connected to the species-neutral concept via a "[subclass of](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P279)" property (e.g. every single "[human neutrophil](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101405102)" is a also "[neutrophil](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q188417)"). 
Our approach was analogous to the one taken by the CELDA ontology to create species-specific cell types. [@wikidata:Q21284308]

#### Integration of PanglaoDB to Wikidata 

After receiving authorization by e-mail from the PanglaoDB developer, Oscar Franzen, the PanglaoDB markers dataset was downloaded manually from PanglaoDB's website (<https://panglaodb.se/markers/PanglaoDB_markers_27_Mar_2020.tsv.gz>) for integration. It contains 15 columns and 8256 rows. Only the columns `species`, `official gene symbol`, and  `cell type` were used for the reconciliation. 
The reconciled dataset was uploaded to Wikidata via the WikidataIntegrator Python package [@https://github.com/SuLab/WikidataIntegrator], a wrapper for the Wikidata Application Programming Interface. 

#### SPARQL queries

Besides the Wikidata Dumps, Wikidata provides a SPARQL endpoint with a Graphical User Interface (<https://query.wikidata.org/>). 
Updated data was immediately accessible via this endpoint, enabling integrative queries integrated with other database statements.

### Results

#### Cell Marker information on Wikidata

Adding marker information on Wikidata was not possible before this study and became possible after we proposed and got community approval of the property "has marker" (P8872).
Figure @fig:chat_marker shows 2 of the current markers of "human colinergic neuron"([Q101405051](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101405051)), [CHAT](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q14863671) and [ACHE](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q407983), as they are seen on Wikidata.
The PanglaoDB is referenced both via URL to the website (<https://panglaodb.se/markers.html>) and a pointer to the PanglaoDB item on Wikidata, [Q99936939](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q99936939).

Now that we re-formatted the markers on PanglaoDB as Linked Open Data, we can make queries that were not possible before, including federated queries with other biological databases, such as Uniprot [@https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql]
and Wikipathways [@https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Portal:Semantic_Web].
Due to previous similar reconciliation projects, Wikidata already contains information about genes, including their relations to Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

PanglaoDB's integration to the Wikidata ecosystem allows us to ask various questions (figure @fig:iscb_results).

SPARQL queries in Wikidata now harness information from Panglao DB. Queries with the above design were run on Wikidata.

### "Which human cell types are related to neurogenesis via their markers?"

As expected, the query below retrieved a series of neuron types, such as "[human Purkinje neuron](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101404913)" and "[human Cajal-retzius cell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101405091)." It also retrieved non-neural cell types such as the "[human loop of Henle cell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101405109), a kidney cell type, and "[human osteoclast](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101404928). 
These seemingly unrelated cell types markedly express genes involved in neurogenesis, but that does not mean that they are involved with this process. 
The unexpected results reinforce that one needs to be careful when using curated pathways to analyze gene sets, as false positives abound.

The molecular process that gene products take part depends on the cell type. SPARQL allows us to seamlessly compare Gene Ontology processes with cell marker data, providing a sandbox to generate hypotheses and explore the biomedical knowledge landscape.

| geneLabel | cellTypeLabel                   |
| :-------- | :------------------------------ |
| OMP       | human purkinje neuron           |
| OMP       | human olfactory epithelial cell |

### "Which cell types express markers associated with Parkinson's disease?"

Besides integration with Gene Ontology, Wikidata reconciliation makes it possible to complement the marker gene info on PanglaoDB with information about diseases. This integration is of biomedical interest, as there is a quest to detail mechanisms that link genetic associations and the diseases themselves.

"Disease genes" are often compiled from Genomic Wide Association Studies, which look for sequence variation in the DNA. These studies are commonly blind to the cell types related to the pathophysiology of the disease. In the query below, we can see cell types marked by genes genetically associated with Parkinson's disease. Even considering the false positives, the overview can aid domain experts in coming up with novel hypotheses.

| geneLabel | diseaseLabel        | cellTypeLabel    |
| :-------- | :------------------ | :--------------- |
| BST1      | Parkinson's disease | human b cell     |
| BST1      | Parkinson's disease | human neutrophil |
| RIT2      | Parkinson's disease | human neuron     |
| SH3GL2    | Parkinson's disease | human alpha cell |
| SH3GL2    | Parkinson's disease | human beta-cell  |

## Discussion and conclusion

In this part of the PhD project, we re-released the knowledge curated in PanglaoDB on Wikidata, connecting it to the semantic web.
Each cell-type/marker statement was added to Wikidata with a pointer to PanglaoDB and a citation of the article, providing proper provenance.
Based on the theoretical considerations on the concept of cell type, we added species-specific terms to Wikidata for cell types of _Homo sapiens_ and _Mus musculus_ described in the PanglaoDB database.

This work exemplifies the power of releasing Linked Open Data via Wikidata, and provides the biomedical community with the first semantically accessible, 5-star LOD dataset of cell markers, easily reachable from Wikidata's SPARQL Query Service (<https://query.wikidata.org/>).
Alongside other case studies of biomedical data integration to Wikidata (see [@wikidata:Q105037759], it contributes with tools and practices to serve as basis for contributors.)
The work also paves the way for reconciling of other databases for cell-type markers, such as CellMarker [@wikidata:Q56984510], labome [@doi:10.13070/mm.en.3.183], CellFinder [@wikidata:Q28660708] and SHOGoiN/CELLPEDIA [@https://stemcellinformatics.org]) (if the owners give proper authorization).
The approach we took here can be applied to any knowledge set of public interest, providing a low-cost and low-barrier platform for sharing biocurated knowledge in gold-standard format.
