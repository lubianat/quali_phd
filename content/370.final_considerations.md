# Final considerations and next steps

To sum up, this PhD research project aims at improving knowledge representation in the context of the Human Cell Atlas. 
It is composed of a mixture of theoretical studies on conceptual modelling, practical contributions to knowledge organization projects (mainly the Cell Ontology and Wikidata), explorations of the data to generate biomedical insights, and a technical framework for organized reading. 
By approaching the object of study from a new perspective, we hope to make sizeable contributions and promote discussion and fruitful conflation of approaches. 

The next years of study will be devoted to improving the projects presented here into mature, useful objects. 
We hope to improve the interplay of Wikidata and Cell Ontology, developing frameworks to combine community- and expert-based curation of knowledge on cell types. 
Furthermore, we plan to integrate Wikidata to current single-cell RNA-sequencing pipelines by adapting R packages to use Wikidata (e.g. the ontology-based packages OnClass [@wikidata:Q108929315] and ontoProc[@wikidata:Q101074371]). 
Finally, we aim at moving the Wikidata Bib system to a well documented, user-friendly mature system, testing usability with other academics and distributing it as a durable open-source project.
