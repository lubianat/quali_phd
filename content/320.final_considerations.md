# Preliminary Results

## Fcoex updates

## The concept of cell type

* Describe background
* Cell types, cell states and cell classes
* Levels of cell type information: archetype, senso stritu cell type, infratype and technotype. 
* Infratypes and technotypes as theoretical innovations
* Current usage mixes archetypes and species-specific cell types
* Annotation of HCA articles for grasping the use of different concepts in the context of HCA

### Next steps

* Improve formalization of cell types in connection with the biomedical semantics community

## HCA 

* "Sky dive" approach: hand annotation of all abstracts and the core Human Cell Atlas paper
* Benefits of using a single ontology that anyone can edit (new terms and speed of science)
* Figure: The different concepts in use by the HCA paper
* Figure: The different concepts in use by the different HCA papers
* Discussion
* Information by HCA and related efforts is already targeted by biocurators. PanglaoDB is one of
these resources etc etc

### Next steps

* Mature the annotation system into a curation tool (based on ANN, perhaps reuse figure)
* Explore the use of SciSpacy and natural language processing for making it easier

## Cell Ontology 

## PanglaoDB integration to Wikidata

* The architecture of marker information on Wikidata
* Integration of information to the larger scope --> live updates by everyone
* Overview of the stats
