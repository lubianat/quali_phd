## The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) Project

<!-- 1.4.1. The Human Cell Atlas project and its scope -->
<!-- 1.4.1.1. Participants -->
The advent of single-cell technologies has ignited the desire for a deep knowledge of cells, the building blocks of life [@wikidata:Q99418649]. 
The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) project has been a major player in the cell knowledge ecosystem, running since 2017 to characterize every cell type in the human body [@wikidata:Q46368626]. 
The HCA consortium gathers people from all over the world to tackle different parts of the project to have a diverse and equitable account of the cell type diversity. [@wikidata:Q100491106]  

<!-- - 1.4.1.2. Overview of main analytical techniques  -->
Building a complete atlas of human cells comes with multiple challenges. The project includes the detection, in single cells, of RNA species (scRNA-Seq), chromatin accessibility (scATAC-Seq), and protein markers (primarily by CYTOF), as well as spatial information on cells with multiplexed _in situ_ hybridization (such as MERFISH) and imaging mass cytometry [@wikidata:Q46368626 ;@wikidata:Q104450645]. Every lab inside the project will contribute with its expertise, providing samples representing human diversity.

HCA is set to revolutionize the biomedical sciences by creating tools and standards for basic research, allowing better characterization of disease, and improving diagnostics and therapy. 
Its products (data, information, knowledge and wisdom) need to be FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.
Data stewardship and management are growing as core demands of the scientific community, ranging from data management plans [@wikidata:Q56524391] to specialized data personnel [@wikidata:Q56524391].

<!-- 1.4.3. Data availability -->
<!-- - 1.4.3.1. As coordinated by the Human Cell Atlas -->
The Human Cell Atlas has a dedicated team for organizing data: the Data Coordination Platform (DCP) [@url:https://data.humancellatlas.org/about] [@wikidata:Q104450645].
The DCP is responsible for tracing the plan for computational interoperability, from the data generators to the consumers.[@wikidata:Q104450645].
The Human Cell Atlas has its portal for data [@url:https://data.humancellatlas.org]), which composes the data repository landscape with other resources, like the Broad Institute Single Cell Portal [https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell>) and the Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub Tabula Sapiens (<https://tabula-sapiens-portal.ds.czbiohub.org/>). 
In addition to its core team, the HCA is poised to grow by community interaction. It states in its opening paper that "As with the Human Genome Project, a robust plan will best emerge from wide-ranging scientific discussions and careful planning".[@wikidata:Q46368626]  
Thus, this project inserts itself among the wide-ranging scientific discussions to improve data - and knowledge - interoperability. 

The highlight of "knowledge" in the last paragraph is meant to stress that raw data _per se_ is not enough to turn the Atlas objectives into reality. 
There is a long way from raw datasets to commonly-agreed scientific knowledge. 
And, ultimately, this long way is what allows humanity to take advantage of scientific endeavours.
Currently, the gap between data and knowledge is mostly targeted by writing and sharing scientific manuscripts, the _de facto_ currency of exchange of claims about the natural world. 
The Human Cell Atlas Publication Committee reviews and selects publications directly part of the HCA.
A set of publications is, thus, one of the significant outputs of the whole endeavour.

The challenge that arises, thus, is one of managing a wealth of information and casting it into useful science.
Experimental articles that analyze thousands of cells pose an overload of information alone. 
Ideally, we would like to understand, remember, and use every statement produced by the HCA.
As this goal is humanely impossible, we need to develop tools to make the knowledge interoperable with the aid of computers. 
At that point, the challenges of the HCA enter in resonance with the challenges of biocuration.
Knowledge representation tools will be discussed in the chapter on ontologies and knowledge graphs of this introduction.
