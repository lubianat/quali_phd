# Classification of cells into types

Given that a core goal of the Human Cell Atlas is to advance knowledge about _all_ human cell types, [@wikidata:Q46368626] the definition of what a cell type is becomes important. 
Although a number of views exist [@wikidata:Q87649649; @doi:10.1242/dev.169854; @doi:10.1242/dev.178996; @wikidata:Q47565008; @wikidata:Q99418657; @wikidata:Q98665291; @wikidata:Q93086971; @wikidata:Q26770736; @wikidata:Q35688096; @wikidata:Q98633613; @wikidata:Q99418649; @wikidata:Q40436539; @wikidata:Q108723646], there is no formal, commonly agreed upon defintion of cell type. 
A 2017 article on the Human Cell Atlas mentions[@wikidata:Q47565008]: 

"Descriptors such as ‘cell type’ and ‘cell state’ can be difficult to define at the moment. An integrative, systematic effort by many teams of scientists working together and bringing different expertise to the problem could dramatically sharpen our terminology, and revolutionize the way we see our cells, tissues and organs. We invite you to join the effort." 
The article highlights both the current gap in knowledge and the need of a community effort to work in that direction, in a direction that justifies the existence of the present work. 

One consequence of a lack of a definition is that there is no commonly agreed number of cell types, and not even on an order of magnitude. 
As of November 2021, the leading answers in the Google Search Engine for the question "How many different cell types are found in the human body?" all point to around 200 different types (https://askabiologist.asu.edu/questions/human-cell-types, https://www.researchgate.net/post/How-many-cell-types-in-a-human-body-How-about-the-number-of-cell-cycles-in-each-species, https://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/types-of-cells-in-the-human-body), an estimate that is agreed upon by Bionumbers, a database of useful biological numbers [@wikidata:Q24643881] (https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?id=103626).
A list of cell types in the adult human body on Wikipedia also amounts to around a couple hundred cell types [@url:https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body&oldid=1044853788].
However, the Cell Ontology has so far had catalogued 2,311 cell types of interest for the Human Cell Atlas as of June 2021 [@wikidata:Q107373831], increasing the estimate by at least one order of magnitude. 
Additionally, with an estimate of 37 trillion cells on average per human body [@wikidata:Q34037445] and an ever-increasing report of new cell types/clusters in single-cell transcriptomics ([@wikidata:Q103034964]), a precise estimate is not reasonable. 
In fact, the Human Cell Atlas project itself does not commit to any estimates of numbers of cell types, due to the sheer difficulty of estimating a number given current knowledge. (Aviv Regev; reply to question in the HCA conference)

Even though there is no agreement, different views on cell types are maturing. 
One core line of thought to define "cell type" is based on the cell type as an evolutionary unit defined by a Core Regulatory Complex (CoRC) of transcription factors. That definition enables the drawing of parallels, from the evolution of other biological entities (such as genes, proteins, and species) to cell types' evolution. Models of how multicellular life works greatly benefit from concepts such as "sister types" (cell types that diverged from a single ancestor), "cell type homology" (cell types in different species that share a common evolutionary origin), and "cell type convergence" (cell types that execute similar functions but which are not directly evolutionarily related) [@pmid:18927580; @doi:10.1038/nrg.2016.127]

Another direction is based on the notion of attractors: regions of dynamical stability in a feature space, which might have different qualities. [@wikidata:Q37475461; @wikidata:Q91908361] In this theory, "basins of attraction" direct cell phenotypes, providing points in, say, a gene expression space towards which different cells "move" their expression programs. This dynamic view see each cell type corresponding to "a self-stabilizing regulatory program, which acts to maintain and restore the cell type-specific program of gene expression." [@wikidata:Q90361677] It alligns itself with dynamic systems theory, and some authors go as far as to say that "Lacking the idea of attractors we have no clear idea of what a cell type is." [@wikidata:Q91316993]

As much as different concepts of species coexist [@doi:10.1080/10635150701701083], our quest to define cell types may take various forms. The challenge of representing cell types in the context of evolution is conceptually different from representing cell types in biomedical experimentation. In that second direction, the groundwork of the Cell Ontology [@wikidata:Q21184168; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-6; @doi:10.1186/s13326-016-0088-7] and CELDA [@wikidata:Q21284308] and the contributions of the International Workshop on Cells in Experimental Life Sciences series [@doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1976-2; @doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2721-9] are notable.

- Standard workflows for scRNA-seq analysis entail assigning labels to cells

- current state of classification of RNAseq data

- Cell Ontology as a source of common identifiers

- Systems

- Nevertheless, the idea of classes of cells is central to current practice.
