# Objectives 
* Set up the semantic infrastructure on Wikidata for handling knowledge about cell types

    * Refine the theories of types/states/classes of cells within the constraints of ontologies and knowledge bases
    * Investigate the types of statements done about cell types
      * On Wikidata
      * On OBO Foundry ontologies
      * Freely on the biomedical literature
    * Craft wikidata relations ("properties") for making cell-type-related assertions (like "has marker" or "is the progenitor of")
  
* Devise ways to connect the Human Cell Atlas products to Wikidata and the Linked Open Data cloud
  * Write bots and scripts to reconcile data sources to Wikidata
  * Create tools for biocuration of Human Cell Atlas products combining text mining and expert curation
  * Project software for reuse of HCA-related knowledge integrated into common bioinformatics workflows.

* Provide proofs-of-concepts of how Wikidata integration can benefit the advancement of HCA
