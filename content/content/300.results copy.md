# Preliminary Results

## The concept of cell type

* Describe background
* Cell types, cell states and cell classes
* Levels of cell type information: archetype, senso stritu cell type, infratype and technotype. 
* Infratypes and technotypes as theoretical innovations
* Current usage mixes archetypes and species-specific cell types
* Multi-level theory of conceptual modelling and a base level for biocuration of cell types

## PanglaoDB integration to Wikidata

* The architecture of marker information on Wikidata
* Integration of information to the larger scope --> live updates by everyone
* Overview of the stats 

## Wikidata and the Cell Ontology interplay

## Wikidata Bib and a professional system for biocuration

### Introduction 

* Accountants have Double-entry bookkeeping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping), software developers have Test-driven development (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).

* Develop a professional way for coverage of large-scale revisions, inspired by Umberto Eco's How to Write a Thesis [@wikidata:Q3684178] adapted to the digital environment, using version-control and semantic links. 

* Connect the reading framework with a Biocuration strategy to feed knowledge to Wikidata
